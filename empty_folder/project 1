During night driving the person expirences glare and can't see opposite or side vehicle because of high beam or high brightnesss.
We can't avoid high brigthness because it will be very useful in low trafic or rural areas.
This project is simple that when the vehicle approach another vehicle opposite side the both start to reduce brightness.
This will automatically change between low to high depending on trafic to non trafic condition.
